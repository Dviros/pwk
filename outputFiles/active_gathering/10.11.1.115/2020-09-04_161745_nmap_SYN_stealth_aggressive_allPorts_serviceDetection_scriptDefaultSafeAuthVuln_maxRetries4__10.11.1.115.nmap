|             Accept header information which would otherwise result in the
|             selection of the wrong variant in many cases. If a browser

|       Slowloris tries to keep many connections to the target web server open and hold

|       the target web server and sending a partial request. By doing so, it starves
|       the http server's resources causing Denial Of Service.

|       The Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol contains a flaw that is
|       triggered when handling Diffie-Hellman key exchanges defined with
|       the DHE_EXPORT cipher. This may allow a man-in-the-middle attacker
|       to downgrade the security of a TLS session to 512-bit export-grade
|       cryptography, which is significantly weaker, allowing the attacker
|       to more easily break the encryption and monitor or tamper with
