TODO:
-need checklist of things found?
-premade checklist of popular frameworks and which technology is used?
-need to have lengthy scans run concurrently if possible
-get service banner for all ports



###-- ACTIVE GATHERING --###
-nmap scans
-service banners via wget, curl on each port?

###-- VULNERABILITY SCANNING --###

###-- WEB APPLICATION ATTACKS --###
# Web Application Enumeration
Technology stack:
	1. Programming lang & framework
	2. Web Server Software (eg. Apache)
	3. Database Software
	4. Server OS

Inspect the site manually:
	1. Inspect URLS (look for file extensions)
		-skipfish shows directories, but takes too long. Shows more 
		results than nmap. Server info
		-nmap http-sitemap-generator finds file ext. Quick.
		Cannot find hidden directories unless explicitly
		told the directory name. nmap --script http-sitemap-generator --script-args url=/ve -p 80 172.16.99.64
		-what tool can find the 172.16.99.64/ii directory?
	2. Inspect page content (Firefox debugger tool)
	3. View Response Headers (Network tool)
	4. Inspect Sitemaps (robots.txt, sitemap.xml)
	5. Locate web server admin consoles (eg. myPhpAdmin, Manager)
-could these be done programmatically eg. eyewitness, selenium
-do we do this for all open ports, as found from nmap scanning?
-the results could go in a .csv which can be opened in LibreOffice?
