Lessons Learned

Lessons Learned

1. Telnet cannot test UDP ports; it strictly uses TCP.

2.  If file sizes are size = 0, it's not worth your time!

3. The server admins can change the server reponse banners! In future, we can try a tool that is specific for OS fingerprinting. I still need to learn to use p0f.

4. Still need to learn the difference between curl ad get when downloading a file

5. Use different user-agents when using netcat
