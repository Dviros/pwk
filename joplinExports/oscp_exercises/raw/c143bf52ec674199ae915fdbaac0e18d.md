## 8.3.1.1.1. Find an NSE script similar to the NFS Exported Share Information Disclosure that was executed in the “Scanning with Individual Nessus Plugins” section. Once found, run the script against Beta in the PWK labs.

nfs-ls
Categories: discovery safe
https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/nfs-ls.html
  Attempts to get useful information about files from NFS exports.
  The output is intended to resemble the output of <code>ls</code>.

  The script starts by enumerating and mounting the remote NFS exports. After
  that it performs an NFS GETATTR procedure call for each mounted point
  in order to get its ACLs.
  For each mounted directory the script will try to list its file entries
  with their attributes.

  Since the file attributes shown in the results are the result of
  GETATTR, READDIRPLUS, and similar procedures, the attributes
  are the attributes of the local filesystem.

  These access permissions are shown only with NFSv3:
  * Read:     Read data from file or read a directory.
  * Lookup:   Look up a name in a directory
              (no meaning for non-directory objects).
  * Modify:   Rewrite existing file data or modify existing
              directory entries.
  * Extend:   Write new data or add directory entries.
  * Delete:   Delete an existing directory entry.
  * Execute:  Execute file (no meaning for a directory).

  Recursive listing is not implemented.
```
