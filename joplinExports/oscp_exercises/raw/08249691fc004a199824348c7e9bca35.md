15.2.3.1

# 15.2.3.1
## 15.2.3.1.1. Connect to your dedicated Linux lab client and start the apache2 service; the target web application is located under **/var/www/https/**.
## 15.2.3.1.2. Modify the original exploit and set the base_url variable to the correct IP address of your dedicated Linux lab client as well as the protocol to HTTPS.
## 15.2.3.1.3. Get familiar with the requests Python library and adjust your exploit accordingly to avoid SSL verification.
## 15.2.3.1.4. Edit the username and password variables to match the ones from our test case (username “admin”, password “HUYfaw763”).
## 15.2.3.1.5. Try to run the exploit against the Linux lab client, does it work? If not, try to explain why.
