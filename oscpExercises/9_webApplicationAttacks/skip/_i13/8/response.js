It also counts\x0a as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\x0a the version number 2.1.]\x0a\x0a          Preamble\x0a\x0a  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\x0afreedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\x0aLicenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\x0afree software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\x0a\x0a  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\x0aspecially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\x0aFree Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\x0acan use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\x0athis license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\x0astrategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.\x0a\x0a  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\x0anot price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\x0ayou have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\x0afor this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\x0ait if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\x0ait in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\x0athese things.\x0a\x0a  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\x0adistributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\x0arights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\x0ayou if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\x0a\x0a  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\x0aor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\x0ayou.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\x0acode.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\x0acomplete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\x0awith the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\x0ait.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\x0a\x0a  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\x0alibrary, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\x0apermission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\x0a\x0a  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\x0athere is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\x0amodified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\x0athat what they have is not the original version, so that the original\x0aauthor\x27s reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\x0aintroduced by others.\x0a\x0a  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\x0aany free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\x0aeffectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\x0arestrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\x0aany patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\x0aconsistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\x0a\x0a  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\x0aordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\x0aGeneral Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\x0ais quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\x0athis license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\x0alibraries into non-free programs.\x0a\x0a  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\x0aa shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\x0acombined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\x0aGeneral Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\x0aentire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\x0aPublic License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\x0athe library.\x0a\x0a  We call this license the \x22Lesser\x22 General Public License because it\x0adoes Less to protect the user\x27s freedom than the ordinary General\x0aPublic License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\x0aof an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\x0aare the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\x0alibraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\x0aspecial circumstances.\x0a\x0a  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\x0aencourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes\x0aa de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be\x0aallowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\x0alibrary does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\x0acase, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\x0asoftware only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\x0a\x0a  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\x0aprograms enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\x0afree software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\x0anon-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\x0aoperating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\x0asystem.\x0a\x0a  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\x0ausers\x27 freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\x0alinked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\x0athat program using a modified version of the Library.\x0a\x0a  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\x0amodification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\x0a\x22work based on the library\x22 and a \x22work that uses the library\x22.  The\x0aformer contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\x0abe combined with the library in order to run.\x0a\x0a      GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\x0a   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\x0a\x0a  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\x0aprogram which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\x0aother authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\x0athis Lesser General Public License (also called \x22this License\x22).\x0aEach licensee is addressed as \x22you\x22.\x0a\x0a  A \x22library\x22 means a collection of software functions and/or data\x0aprepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\x0a(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\x0a\x0a  The \x22Library\x22, below, refers to any such software library or work\x0awhich has been distributed under these terms.  A \x22work based on the\x0aLibrary\x22 means either the Library or any derivative work under\x0acopyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\x0aportion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\x0astraightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\x0aincluded without limitation in the term \x22modification\x22.)\x0a\x0a  \x22Source code\x22 for a work means the preferred form of the work for\x0amaking modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\x0aall the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\x0ainterface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation\x0aand installation of the library.\x0a\x0a  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\x0acovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\x0arunning a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\x0asuch a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\x0aon the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\x0awriting it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\x0aand what the program that uses the Library does.\x0a  \x0a  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library\x27s\x0acomplete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\x0ayou conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\x0aappropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\x0aall the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\x0awarranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\x0aLibrary.\x0a\x0a  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\x0aand you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\x0afee.\x0a\x0a  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\x0aof it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\x0adistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\x0aabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\x0a\x0a    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\x0a\x0a    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\x0a    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\x0a\x0a    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\x0a    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\x0a\x0a    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\x0a    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\x0a    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\x0a    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\x0a    in the event an application does not supply such function or\x0a    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\x0a    its purpose remains meaningful.\x0a\x0a    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\x0a    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\x0a    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\x0a    application-supplied function or table used by this function must\x0a    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\x0a    root function must still compute square roots.)\x0a\x0aThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\x0aidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\x0aand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\x0athemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\x0asections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\x0adistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\x0aon the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\x0athis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\x0aentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\x0ait.\x0a\x0aThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\x0ayour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\x0aexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\x0acollective works based on the Library.\x0a\x0aIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\x0awith the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\x0aa storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\x0athe scope of this License.\x0a\x0a  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\x0aLicense instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\x0athis, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\x0athat they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\x0ainstead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\x0aordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\x0athat version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\x0athese notices.\x0a\x0a  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\x0athat copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\x0asubsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\x0a\x0a  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\x0athe Library into a program that is not a library.\x0a\x0a  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\x0aderivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\x0aunder the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\x0ait with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\x0amust be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\x0amedium customarily used for software interchange.\x0a\x0a  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\x0afrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\x0asource code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\x0adistribute the source code, even though third parties are not\x0acompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\x0a\x0a  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\x0aLibrary, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\x0alinked with it, is called a \x22work that uses the Library\x22.  Such a\x0awork, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\x0atherefore falls outside the scope of this License.\x0a\x0a  However, linking a \x22work that uses the Library\x22 with the Library\x0acreates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\x0acontains portions of the Library), rather than a \x22work that uses the\x0alibrary\x22.  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\x0aSection 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\x0a\x0a  When a \x22work that uses the Library\x22 uses material from a header file\x0athat is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\x0aderivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\x0aWhether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\x0alinked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\x0athreshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\x0a\x0a  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\x0astructure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\x0afunctions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\x0afile is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\x0awork.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\x0aLibrary will still fall under Section 6.)\x0a\x0a  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\x0adistribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\x0aAny executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\x0awhether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\x0a\x0a  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\x0alink a \x22work that uses the Library\x22 with the Library to produce a\x0awork containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\x0aunder terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\x0amodification of the work for the customer\x27s own use and reverse\x0aengineering for debugging such modifications.\x0a\x0a  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\x0aLibrary is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\x0athis License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\x0aduring execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\x0acopyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\x0adirecting the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\x0aof these things:\x0a\x0a    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\x0a    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\x0a    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\x0a    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\x0a    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \x22work that\x0a    uses the Library\x22, as object code and/or source code, so that the\x0a    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\x0a    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\x0a    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\x0a    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\x0a    to use the modified definitions.)\x0a\x0a    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\x0a    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\x0a    copy of the library already present on the user\x27s computer system,\x0a    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\x0a    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\x0a    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\x0a    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\x0a\x0a    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at\x0a    least three years, to give the same user the materials\x0a    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\x0a    than the cost of performing this distribution.\x0a\x0a    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\x0a    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\x0a    specified materials from the same place.\x0a\x0a    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\x0a    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\x0a\x0a  For an executable, the required form of the \x22work that uses the\x0aLibrary\x22 must include any data and utility programs needed for\x0areproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\x0athe materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\x0anormally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\x0acomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\x0awhich the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\x0athe executable.\x0a\x0a  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\x0arestrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\x0aaccompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\x0ause both them and the Library together in an executable that you\x0adistribute.\x0a\x0a  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\x0aLibrary side-by-side in a single library together with other library\x0afacilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\x0alibrary, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\x0athe Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\x0apermitted, and provided that you do these two things:\x0a\x0a    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\x0a    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\x0a    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\x0a    Sections above.\x0a\x0a    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\x0a    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\x0a    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\x0a\x0a  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\x0athe Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\x0aattempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\x0adistribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\x0arights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\x0aor rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\x0aterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\x0a\x0a  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\x0asigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\x0adistribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\x0aprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\x0amodifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\x0aLibrary), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\x0aall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\x0athe Library or works based on it.\x0a\x0a  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\x0aLibrary), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\x0aoriginal licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\x0asubject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\x0arestrictions on the recipients\x27 exercise of the rights granted herein.\x0aYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\x0athis License.\x0a\x0a  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\x0ainfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\x0aconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\x0aotherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\x0aexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\x0adistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\x0aLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\x0amay not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\x0alicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\x0aall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\x0athe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\x0arefrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\x0a\x0aIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\x0aparticular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,\x0aand the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\x0a\x0aIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\x0apatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\x0asuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\x0aintegrity of the free software distribution system which is\x0aimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\x0agenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\x0athrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\x0asystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\x0ato distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\x0aimpose that choice.\x0a\x0aThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\x0abe a consequence of the rest of this License.\x0a\x0a  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\x0acertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\x0aoriginal copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add\x0aan explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,\x0aso that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus\x0aexcluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if\x0awritten in the body of this License.\x0a\x0a  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\x0aversions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\x0aSuch new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\x0abut may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\x0a\x0aEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\x0aspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\x0a\x22any later version\x22, you have the option of following the terms and\x0aconditions either of that version or of any later version published by\x0athe Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\x0alicense version number, you may choose any version ever published by\x0athe Free Software Foundation.\x0a\x0a  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\x0aprograms whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\x0awrite to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\x0acopyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\x0aSoftware Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\x0adecision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\x0aof all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\x0aand reuse of software generally.\x0a\x0a          NO WARRANTY\x0a\x0a  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\x0aWARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\x0aEXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\x0aOTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \x22AS IS\x22 WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\x0aKIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\x0aIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\x0aPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\x0aLIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\x0aTHE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\x0a\x0a  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\x0aWRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\x0aAND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\x0aFOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\x0aCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\x0aLIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\x0aRENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\x0aFAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\x0aSUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\x0aDAMAGES.\x0a\x0a         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\x0a\x0a           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\x0a\x0a  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\x0apossible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\x0aeveryone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\x0aredistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the\x0aordinary General Public License).\x0a\x0a  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is\x0asafest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\x0aconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the\x0a\x22copyright\x22 line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\x0a\x0a    \x3cone line to give the library\x27s name and a brief idea of what it does.\x3e\x0a    Copyright (C) \x3cyear\x3e  \x3cname of author\x3e\x0a\x0a    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\x0a    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\x0a    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\x0a    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\x0a\x0a    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\x0a    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\x0a    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
