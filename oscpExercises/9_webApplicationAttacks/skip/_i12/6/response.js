The visitor can enter a keyword and the plugin will show him a few suggestion via an AJAX request before submitting the search query. The visitor can continue his search by pressing enter or he/she can use the keyboard arrows (up and down) to visit directly a suggested post.\x0a\x0a== Installation ==\x0a\x0aInstalling WP AutoSuggest is very straight forward:\x0a\x0a1. Upload `wp-autosuggest` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory\x0a1. Activate the plugin through the \x27Plugins\x27 menu in WordPress\x0a1. We\x27re done!\x0a\x0aSome templates have the search input ID changed which is by default `s`, you change it from the `WP AutoSuggest` settings page.\x0a\x0a== Screenshots ==\x0a\x0a1. Here is a screenshot of plugin in action with browser that has support for CSS3.\x0a2. A screenshot of plugin in action with browser that does not support CSS3 or has CSS3 support disabled.\x0a\x0a== Changelog - from 0.23 to 0.24 ==\x0a - CSS has been fixed to validate. ( background-image: transparent; -\x3e background: transparent; )\x0a== Changelog - from 0.22 to 0.23 ==\x0a - Move images to plugin\x27s root directory/images and update CSS accordingly\x0a   to this location. Most wp extensions store images like this and while this\x0a   is completely invisible to end user - it makes it simpler for developers.\x0a - Pressing enter on search field did not submit form earlierly on all\x0a   browsers. This now has been changed and advantage is that when wp-autosuggest\x0a   is enabled, user can have a form without submit button and form is submitted\x0a   by pressing ENTER when cursor is on search field. (Some browsers would do\x0a   this behavior even without the code)\x0a== Changelog - from 0.21 to 0.22 ==\x0a - Changed loading of javascript and css to new way which was introduced in\x0a   wordpress 2.7 and should be used since then - this new way to define loading\x0a   of scripts and styles avoids them from loading twice - and there also are\x0a   plugins that allow installation to use google hosted scripts if available\x0a   as well - but they only work if you use this new way.\x0a   Unfortunately this breaks compatibility to older WP installations than 2.7\x0a   - although this COULD be made backwards compatible by checking first if\x0a   wp_enqueue_script and wp_enqueue_style functions are missing and in that\x0a   case software would use the old way. This has not been done in 0.22.\x0a   If you are using older than 2.7 - Do not upgrade to v0.22\x0a\x0a== Changelog - from 0.2 to 0.21 ==\x0a - Changed readme.txt\x0a\x0a== Changelog - from 0.1 to 0.2 ==\x0a\x0a - Round corners only worked nicely with white background (images didn\x27t have transparency);\x0a   Removed round corner images for container and made corners round with CSS3.\x0a - Changed \x22tip\x22 graphic\x0a - wp-autosuggest html: layout has been simplified\x0a - wp-autosuggest css: removed unnecessary parts\x0a - Localization support added:\x0a\x09- tested that it works with and without languageswitcher plugin\x0a\x09- removed setting that contained \x22no results\x22 text, this now on is fetched from localization file\x0a\x09- fixed broken support for international characters\x0a - Fixed a typo in the beginning of javascript file (there was extra \x227\x22 before comments in beginning of file)\x0a - Removed some unnecessary files.\x0az\x1b$wa\x84\x1a\xe5\xbb\x08\xd5\xd1'}
