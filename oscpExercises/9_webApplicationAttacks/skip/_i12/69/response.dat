                  getID3() Commercial License
                  ===========================

getID3() is licensed under the "GNU Public License" (GPL) and/or the
"getID3() Commercial License" (gCL). This document describes the gCL.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

The license is non-exclusively granted to a single person or company,
per payment of the license fee, for the lifetime of that person or
company. The license is non-transferrable.

The gCL grants the licensee the right to use getID3() in commercial
closed-source projects. Modifications may be made to getID3() with no
obligation to release the modified source code. getID3() (or pieces
thereof) may be included in any number of projects authored (in whole
or in part) by the licensee.

The licensee may use any version of getID3(), past, present or future,
as is most convenient. This license does not entitle the licensee to
receive any technical support, updates or bugfixes, except as such are
made publicly available to all getID3() users.

The licensee may not sub-license getID3() itself, meaning that any
commercially released product containing all or parts of getID3() must
have added functionality beyond what is available in getID3();
getID3() itself may not be re-licensed by the licensee.
